- For every markdown file in docs/, ensure there is a corresponding file in docs/ru/ with the same relative path and filename.
- When a file is added, changed, renamed, or deleted in docs/, mirror the change in docs/ru/.
- If a translation is missing in docs/ru/, create a stub with a notice for translation.
- When a file is changed in docs/ru/, check if docs/ has the same relative path. If so, suggest to update the English version if the Russian file is newer.
- Subdirectories and their contents should be mirrored between docs/ and docs/ru/.
- Directory structure changes (create, rename, delete) in docs/ should be reflected in docs/ru/.
- This rule set is bi-directional, but prioritizes English (docs/) as the source of truth.
- Exclude double translation (do not translate docs/ru/ back into docs/ru/).
- You can check updates via `Recent changes`

Examples:
- docs/plugins/official/scenes.md <=> docs/ru/plugins/official/scenes.md
- docs/index.md <=> docs/ru/index.md
- docs/guides/usage.md <=> docs/ru/guides/usage.md

If a translation is missing, create a stub in docs/ru/ with a clear notice: "TODO: Translate from docs/{relative_path}".
